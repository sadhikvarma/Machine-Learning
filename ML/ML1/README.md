# Basics and Supervised algorithms for Machine Learning 

This document contains a comprehensive list of programming tasks used in  machine learning. These tasks cover a wide range of topics, including matrix operations, statistical analysis, data manipulation, and the implementation of different machine learning algorithms. 

## 1. Write a Program to perform the following operations on matrices:
   a) Matrix addition  
   b) Matrix Subtraction  
   c) Matrix Multiplication  
   d) Matrix Inversion  
   e) Transpose of a Matrix  

## 2. Write a Program to perform the following operations:
   a) Find the minimum and maximum element of the matrix  
   b) Find the minimum and maximum element of each row in the matrix  
   c) Find the minimum and maximum element of each column in the matrix  
   d) Find the trace of the given matrix  
   e) Find the rank of the given matrix  
   f) Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the given matrix  

## 3. Write a Program to find the mean, median, standard deviation, and mode using user-defined functions.

## 4. Create a data frame with columns and at least 5 observations:
   a) Retrieve a particular column from the DataFrame  
   b) Summarize the data frame and observe the statistics of the DataFrame created  
   c) Observe the mean and standard deviation of the data frame and print the values  

## 5. Write a program to implement Linear Regression for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the Mean Square Error by considering a few test datasets.

## 6. Write a program to implement Non-linear Regression for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the Mean Square Error by considering a few test datasets.

## 7. Write a program to implement Logistic Regression for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier.

## 8. Write a program to implement the Naïve Bayesian classifier for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering a few test datasets.

## 9. Write a program to implement the k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify the iris dataset. Print both correct and wrong predictions.

## 10. Write a program to implement the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify the iris dataset. Print both correct and wrong predictions.

## 11. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree-based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate dataset for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
