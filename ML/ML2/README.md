# Part b contains this

These tasks cover a wide range of topics, including  association rule mining, and various clustering algorithms. 

## Association Rule Mining

Association rule mining is a technique used to uncover interesting relationships, patterns, and associations within large datasets. It is commonly used in market basket analysis to find sets of items that frequently co-occur in transactions.

### Apriori Algorithm
The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm used for mining frequent itemsets and generating association rules. It uses a breadth-first search strategy and relies on the property that any subset of a frequent itemset must also be frequent.

### FP-Growth Algorithm
The FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) algorithm is an efficient and scalable method for mining frequent itemsets. Unlike Apriori, it uses a divide-and-conquer strategy and compresses the dataset using a structure called the FP-tree (Frequent Pattern Tree).

### Task: Generate Association Rules
1. Write a program to generate Association Rules using the Apriori algorithm.
2. Write a program to generate Association Rules using the FP-Growth algorithm.

## Clustering Algorithms

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points into clusters. It helps in identifying patterns and structures in data.

### K-means Clustering
K-means is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters. It iteratively assigns data points to clusters based on the nearest mean and updates the cluster centroids until convergence.

### Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering that builds a hierarchy of clusters. It can be performed in two ways: Agglomerative (bottom-up) and Divisive (top-down).

### DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measure and a minimum number of points. It can identify clusters of arbitrary shape and handle noise.

### Graph-Based Clustering
Graph-based clustering algorithms use graph theory to represent the relationships between data points. These algorithms partition the graph into clusters based on various criteria like edge weights, connectivity, and more.

### Task: Implement Clustering Algorithms
1. Write a program to implement the K-means clustering algorithm.
2. Write a program to implement hierarchical clustering algorithms.
3. Write a program to implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.
4. Write a program to implement a graph-based clustering algorithm.
