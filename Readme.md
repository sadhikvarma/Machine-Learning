# Learning Repository

Welcome to my learning repository. This repository contains three main areas of my study: Machine Learning (ML), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each folder contains a collection of tasks  that I have completed to deepen my understanding and skills in these fields.

## Folders

### ML (Machine Learning)
This folder contains my learning materials  related to Machine Learning. Here, you will find various algorithms and techniques implemented to solve different problems. The focus is on supervised and unsupervised learning, including tasks like regression, classification, clustering, and more.

### DL (Deep Learning)
This folder contains my work related to Deep Learning. It includes various algorithms and their applications. Here, you'll find implementations of different neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GANs, and more.

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
This folder contains my projects and exercises in Natural Language Processing. The focus is on understanding and implementing various NLP techniques and algorithms to process and analyze textual data. Projects include tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, sentiment analysis, and more.
